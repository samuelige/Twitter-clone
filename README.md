Twitter clone
Let’s sharpen our HTML/CSS skills and where better to start than with the Twitter's landing page. In this project, you will need to recreate the Twitter's homepage. In other words, type in twitter.com” in your browser. See what’s there? Try recreating that from scratch! That’s the challenge. Do not worry about recreating any drop downs; instead, you should exclusively focus on reproducing the static content on the page. That means recreating the navbar (minus dropdowns), the sign-in button, the main body of the page, and the footer. It also means positioning and styling each of these elements so that they basically resemble the original. Also adapt it for mobile by making it mobile responsive
Note
In order to easily make your code cross-browser compatible, include a “CSS Reset.” The most popular CSS reset is Eric Meyer’s, which you can copy here and paste in at the very top of your main.css. And in case you missed it, there’s a brief discussion of CSS resets here in the Beginner’s Guide.
Once you’re happy with your project, and it is already on github, you can publish it live on the web using GitHub Pages. On your computer, navigate to your project folder using the git command line, then run the following commands in order:
git add -A
git commit -a -m “Initializing repo for GH Pages”
git push origin gh-pages
